## dotfiles ##

This project contains files to setup my system. It's not so complete as [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) but i prefer to keep my configuration simple, fast and maintainable

## Installation ##

Clone into your home directory
```shell
  git clone https://github.com/seronmarlon/dotfiles.git .dotfiles
```


Inside the project directory run the install script:

```shell
